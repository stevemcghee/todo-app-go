# Milestone 1: Risk Analysis & Planning

This document outlines the initial planning phase where we identified critical risks and defined the roadmap for production readiness.

## 2. What was Implemented?

In this milestone, we didn't write application code. Instead, we performed a **Risk Assessment** of the "toy app" to identify what was missing for a production environment.

**Key Deliverables:**
*   **Risk Mitigation Plan**: A detailed analysis of Single Points of Failure (SPOF), security vulnerabilities, and scalability bottlenecks.
*   **Implementation Plan**: A phased roadmap to address these risks.

**Benefits:**
*   **Clarity**: Defined "done" for production readiness.
*   **Prioritization**: Focused on high-impact risks (e.g., database password security) early.

## 3. Pitfalls & Considerations

*   **Over-planning**: It's easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis. We time-boxed this phase to ensure we started coding quickly.
*   **Unknown Unknowns**: Initial plans often change. We kept the plan living and updated it as we discovered new constraints (e.g., GKE regional costs).

## 4. Alternatives Considered

*   **"YOLO" Deployment**: We could have just deployed the app to Cloud Run immediately.
    *   *Why not?* We wanted to demonstrate a *robust* architecture (GKE, HA Cloud SQL) suitable for larger enterprises, not just the simplest possible deployment.
